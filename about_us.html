        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>According to us the biggest cliché that exist, is the way Mental illness is being delt in our society.</p>
            <p>Due to lack of awareness in our society, generally people aren’t able to understand the person suffering instead put them under pressure of being judged negatively, this results in suffering person isolating himself and having no one to speak his/her heart out.
            The conditions of suffering person increases due to the cliché(lack of awareness & negligence) that exist.</p>
            
            <p>To kill this cliché we built a website, where we tried to rectify all the loopholes in present system.
            Firstly the concern of awareness comes up, to rectify that we have a separated page for making people, person suffering , and close ones of that person aware about it and making them believe that you can overcome it. Adding to the awareness page we too have a PsycoBot which adds to the awareness part of our project(detailed functioning of PsycoBot is listed below).</p>
            
            <p>Once we make sure that we are able to make people aware and sensitive regarding this grave issue, due to still prevailing negligence in the society and fear of judgement for the concerned person, we designed a Bot where the person suffering from any type of mental illness can go and speak his/her heart out. 
            Why he/she will do that:-
            This website will be the place where your anonymity will be maintained, so no fear of judgement will exist.</p>
            
            <p>Speaking your negative thoughts out gives the concerned person a sense of relief from frustration, and lightens up their mood, which is why this Bot will help them let their thoughts out that society don’t allow by giving him appropriate replies, giving him the impression of an understanding person that no one did for him in the real world, hence this Bot will slowly help in curing that person.
