# About Psychologix
Psychologix is a website which tries to create awareness in the society towards mental health. It lets the user know that they are not the only ones and makes them believe that you can overcome it! Furthermore, we have a PyschoBot where the user can talk about anything without the fear of being judged. fun fact the bot is available all the time unlike timely human presence :alien:

# Features
 * ### **Awareness**
 The concern of awareness comes up, to rectify that we have a separated page for making people, person suffering , and close ones of that person aware about it and making them believe that you can overcome it.
 * ### **Psychobot**
PsychoBot will have interactive conversations with the user, making him feel inclusive, safe and giving him an impression of a person who understands him like no one else does.As we know that sometimes the cases of mental illness reach a level where human guidance of a specialist (being it a psychologist or counsellor) becomes necessary, in that case our idea was to give control of the same chat window to a psychologist  replacing the Bot from the other end. But due to time constraints of this code jam , we  werenâ€™t able to put in that functioning, but instead of it, once our Bot recognises that issue , it sends in the contact of psychologists to be contacted for better treatment from the user.
 * ### **Anonymity**
 The website does not ask for any login credentials, hence the user can chat without revealing his/her identity which prevents the fear of judgement.


# Future features
 * More interactive bot.
 * Games and Music corner.
 * Developing BOT using a language. 
 * Psychologist take over the same chat window.
 * Adding stories of people who have battled with mental illness on the awareness page.
