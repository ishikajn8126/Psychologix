# About Psychologix
Psychologix is a website which tries to create awareness in the society towards mental health. It lets the user know that they are not the only ones suffering and makes them believe that you can overcome it! Furthermore, we have a PyschoBot where the user can talk about anything without the fear of being judged. fun fact the bot is available all the time unlike timely human presence :alien:


# Theme

According to us the biggest cliché that exist, is the way Mental illness is being dealt in our society. 

### Present Day Scenerio:- 
Due to lack of awareness in our society, generally people aren’t able to understand the person suffering instead put them under pressure of being judged negatively, this results in suffering person isolating himself and having no one to speak his/her heart out.

### Killing The Cliche:- 
To have a better way of dealing with people suffering from mental illness other than the existing cliche, we built a website which firstly promotes awareness through a separate page and Bot, and secondly provides user with a safe anonymous platform in form of Bot where they can speak their heart out, without having fear of judgement. 

### Getting a place where Bot understands the person, listen everything without judging the person and without asking for his/ her identity is what will helps a mentally retarded person to recovery

# Features
 * ### **Awareness**
    The concern of awareness comes up, to rectify that we have a separated page for making people, person suffering , and close ones of that person aware about it and     making them believe that you can overcome it.
 * ### **Psychobot**
    PsychoBot will have interactive conversations with the user, making him feel inclusive, safe and giving him an impression of a person who understands him like no       one else does.As we know that sometimes the cases of mental illness reach a level where human guidance of a specialist (being it a psychologist or counsellor)         becomes necessary, in that case our idea was to give control of the same chat window to a psychologist  replacing the Bot from the other end. But due to time           constraints of this code jam , we  weren’t able to put in that functioning, but instead of it, once our Bot recognises that issue , it sends in the contact of         psychologists to be contacted for better treatment from the user.
